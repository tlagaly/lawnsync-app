# LawnSync - Project Brief

## Project Vision
LawnSync is a mobile application designed to simplify lawn care through personalized, AI-driven recommendations. Our goal is to help homeowners achieve healthier, more beautiful lawns with minimal effort, regardless of their gardening expertise.

## Problem Statement
Many homeowners struggle with lawn care due to limited knowledge, time constraints, and inconsistent information sources. Current solutions are either too generic (not accounting for specific conditions) or too complex for casual users.

## Solution Overview
LawnSync bridges this gap by providing:
1. Personalized lawn care plans based on location, grass type, and specific yard conditions
2. AI-driven recommendations that adapt to weather and seasonal changes
3. Visual tracking of lawn improvement over time
4. Simplified task management with timely reminders
5. Gradual expansion to include other landscaping elements

## Target Users
- Primary: Busy homeowners with limited lawn care knowledge who want better results without significant time investment
- Secondary: Lawn enthusiasts seeking to optimize their approach and solve specific problems

## Core Requirements
1. User-friendly onboarding that collects critical lawn data
2. Personalized lawn care plan generator
3. Weather-adaptive task scheduling
4. Visual progress tracking with before/after comparisons
5. Problem area identification and targeted solutions
6. Mobile-first design optimized for in-yard usage

## Success Metrics
- User retention rate after 3 months
- Percentage of users documenting lawn improvement via photos
- Task completion rate
- User satisfaction with lawn improvement
- Time spent on lawn care (reduction goal)

## Technical Approach
- React web application with responsive design for all devices
- Firebase and Supabase for backend services
- Integration with OpenWeatherMap for local climate data
- Plant.id API for plant and weed identification
- OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo for personalized advice generation

  - Days 1-7: Core infrastructure and setup
  - Days 8-14: Onboarding flow implementation
  - Days 15-21: Authentication and dashboard components
  - Days 22-28: AI features and remaining app sections
  - Days 29-30: Testing and launch preparation
