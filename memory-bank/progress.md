[2025-05-08 12:49:00] - Created comprehensive plan for app restructuring using jobs-to-be-done approach. Defined new sitemap based on user goals, created detailed implementation plan with a phased approach spanning 11-17 days, documented architectural decision and rationale, and updated active context with new focus areas.

[2025-05-08 13:07:00] - Implemented Phase 1 of the jobs-to-be-done restructuring. Created MainNavigationBar component with responsive design for both desktop and mobile. Developed PageLayout component as a consistent template for all sections. Implemented skeleton container components for all new sections (FixIssuesContainer, MaintainContainer, ImproveContainer, TrackContainer, ResourcesContainer). Updated App.tsx with new routing structure. Now ready to test the navigation system.

[2025-05-08 13:19:00] - Enhanced the navigation implementation by creating an AppLayout component to wrap the MainNavigationBar around all protected routes. Fixed positioning for responsive layouts with desktop navigation at top and mobile navigation at bottom of screen. Integrated this into the routing system using React Router's nested routes. Encountered Firebase authentication errors during testing which will need to be addressed.

[2025-05-09 15:53:00] - Started implementation of the Tasks and Projects section, creating a feature branch (feature/tasks-projects-section). This section will consolidate task management features into a cohesive, goal-oriented interface with tabbed navigation for daily/weekly tasks, seasonal projects, and custom projects. Will migrate existing TaskScheduler functionality from the maintain section and create a new ProjectCard component.

[2025-05-09 15:57:00] - Implemented Tasks and Projects section with enhanced functionality. Created a tabbed interface for Daily/Weekly Tasks, Seasonal Projects, and Custom Projects. Migrated the TaskScheduler component from the maintain section to the Daily/Weekly Tasks tab. Integrated SeasonalTasks component into the Seasonal Projects tab. Developed ProjectCard component for displaying project details with progress tracking. Created NewProjectForm component for adding custom lawn projects. Implemented responsive design with mobile-first approach. Added unit tests for all new components.

[2025-05-09 16:37:28] - Updated app navigation and notification UI by moving main navigation links to Header component for desktop view while keeping bottom navigation bar only for tablet and mobile views. Implemented slide-in notification drawer from header icon instead of dropdown. Removed duplicate notification button from HomeContainer content section. This change improves UI consistency and reduces redundancy while enhancing the user experience on different screen sizes.

[2025-05-09 17:00:00] - Refactored memory bank documentation to accurately reflect completed work and current navigation structure. Updated productContext.md with documentation of the navigation evolution from feature-centric to jobs-to-be-done to the current 5-section user-centric approach. Updated activeContext.md to mark completed items and resolved questions. Updated progress.md to reflect current status and add production deployment preparation section. This refactoring ensures the memory bank accurately captures project history while documenting the current trajectory.
