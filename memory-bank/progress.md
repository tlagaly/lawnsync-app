## Current Tasks
- Building mobile-first UI components with the LawnSync theme
- Integrating with OpenWeatherMap API for real-time weather data
- Implementing Weather-Adaptive Task Scheduling system
- Implementing AI recommendation engine
- Building photo gallery and comparison tools

## Known Issues & Challenges
- Need to determine optimal approach for storing and processing lawn images
- Weather data integration will require careful API selection for granularity vs. cost
- AI recommendation engine will need extensive training for diverse climate zones
- Potential compatibility issues with Chakra UI 3.17.0 - currently working around by using native HTML/CSS

## Notes & Observations
- The visual timeline feature will be critical for user engagement and satisfaction
- Mobile-first design should prioritize in-yard usability with simple controls
- Consider offline mode functionality for areas with poor connectivity

[2025-05-05 14:35:00] - Initial progress tracking documentation
[2025-05-05 22:52:00] - Created Vite+React project, implemented core UI theme foundations with mobile-first design

[2025-05-05 23:05:00] - Implemented initial user onboarding flow with multi-step navigation, welcome screen, and location selection screen. Set up React Router for onboarding navigation and created a mobile-first UI using the established Chakra theme styling patterns.

[2025-05-05 23:12:00] - Implemented user onboarding flow with multi-step navigation using pure React components with inline styling (avoiding ChakraUI dependency issues). Created the component architecture with StepIndicator, OnboardingNavigation and OnboardingLayout components. Developed Welcome screen with value proposition and Location screen with search functionality. Set up React Router for navigation between onboarding steps, establishing the foundation for the complete flow.

[2025-05-05 23:30:00] - Implemented remaining onboarding screens for LawnSync. Created the Lawn Type screen with a visual grid selection interface, Goals screen with a multi-select interface, and Review screen to summarize user selections. Integrated Leaflet.js into the Location screen for map visualization. Updated the OnboardingContainer to handle the flow between all screens with proper state management for user selections.

[2025-05-05 23:52:00] - Implemented complete dashboard feature with personalized lawn care plan UI. Created multiple dashboard components: DashboardHeader with location and lawn type display, WeatherCard with conditions and forecast, TaskList with prioritized lawn care tasks, ProgressTracker with visual lawn health indicators, and QuickActions with quick access buttons. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the user's lawn care needs and progress.

[2025-05-06 00:19:00] - Fixed dashboard implementation and resolved Chakra UI compatibility issues. Switched dashboard components from using Chakra UI components to native HTML/CSS with inline styling. Modified DashboardHeader, WeatherCard, TaskList, ProgressTracker, and QuickActions components to work without ChakraProvider dependency. Removed ChakraProvider from App.tsx to eliminate the context error. Successfully tested the flow from onboarding to dashboard, confirming proper functionality of all components with mock data.

[2025-05-06 00:42:00] - Set up Git version control workflow. Initialized GitHub repository at https://github.com/tlagaly/lawnsync-app, created master and development branches following GitFlow principles, and established PR/issue templates. Created comprehensive Git workflow documentation to guide the team's collaboration process.

[2025-05-06 00:59:00] - Implemented complete Firebase Authentication and user account system. Set up Firebase Authentication services, created Zustand stores for auth and user profiles, implemented login/signup screens with email/password authentication, added protected routes using React Router, modified onboarding flow to prompt for account creation after completing the profile setup, and created an account settings page for profile management. This connects the onboarding flow to the dashboard while ensuring user data persistence.

[2025-05-06 01:07:00] - Implemented Firebase mock implementation for local testing. Created mock versions of Firebase Authentication and Firestore database that work entirely in-memory. Added simulated network delays for realistic testing, console logging for visibility into mock operations, and flags to easily switch between mock and real implementations. This allows developers to test the application locally without requiring an actual Firebase project setup.

[2025-05-06 01:45:00] - Implemented OpenWeatherMap API integration for real-time weather data on the dashboard. Created a weather service with mock/real toggle following the Firebase pattern for testing flexibility. The service includes proper geocoding, caching, and error handling. Updated the WeatherCard component to display dynamic weather conditions and forecast data from the user's lawn location. Added contextual lawn care tips based on current weather conditions to provide actionable recommendations to users.

[2025-05-06 10:41:00] - Implemented Weather-Adaptive Task Scheduling system. Created the TaskSchedulerService with mock/real toggle pattern following established service architecture. Developed TypeScript interfaces for the scheduling system in scheduler.ts. Built a mobile-first TaskScheduler component with an interactive calendar view, weather indicators, and task management features. Enhanced the existing TaskList component with weather appropriateness indicators and detailed task view. Updated the Dashboard to include tab navigation between task list and calendar views. The system provides weather-based task recommendations and allows users to easily reschedule tasks based on optimal conditions.
