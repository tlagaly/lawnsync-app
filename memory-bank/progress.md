## Current Tasks
- Building mobile-first UI components with the LawnSync theme
- Preparing for implementation of dashboard components
- Setting up Firebase and Supabase services

## Known Issues & Challenges
- Need to determine optimal approach for storing and processing lawn images
- Weather data integration will require careful API selection for granularity vs. cost
- AI recommendation engine will need extensive training for diverse climate zones
- Potential compatibility issues with Chakra UI 3.17.0 - currently working around by using native HTML/CSS

## Notes & Observations
- The visual timeline feature will be critical for user engagement and satisfaction
- Mobile-first design should prioritize in-yard usability with simple controls
- Consider offline mode functionality for areas with poor connectivity

[2025-05-05 14:35:00] - Initial progress tracking documentation
[2025-05-05 22:52:00] - Created Vite+React project, implemented core UI theme foundations with mobile-first design

[2025-05-05 23:05:00] - Implemented initial user onboarding flow with multi-step navigation, welcome screen, and location selection screen. Set up React Router for onboarding navigation and created a mobile-first UI using the established Chakra theme styling patterns.

[2025-05-05 23:12:00] - Implemented user onboarding flow with multi-step navigation using pure React components with inline styling (avoiding ChakraUI dependency issues). Created the component architecture with StepIndicator, OnboardingNavigation and OnboardingLayout components. Developed Welcome screen with value proposition and Location screen with search functionality. Set up React Router for navigation between onboarding steps, establishing the foundation for the complete flow.

[2025-05-05 23:30:00] - Implemented remaining onboarding screens for LawnSync. Created the Lawn Type screen with a visual grid selection interface, Goals screen with a multi-select interface, and Review screen to summarize user selections. Integrated Leaflet.js into the Location screen for map visualization. Updated the OnboardingContainer to handle the flow between all screens with proper state management for user selections.

[2025-05-05 23:52:00] - Implemented complete dashboard feature with personalized lawn care plan UI. Created multiple dashboard components: DashboardHeader with location and lawn type display, WeatherCard with conditions and forecast, TaskList with prioritized lawn care tasks, ProgressTracker with visual lawn health indicators, and QuickActions with quick access buttons. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the user's lawn care needs and progress.

[2025-05-06 00:19:00] - Fixed dashboard implementation and resolved Chakra UI compatibility issues. Switched dashboard components from using Chakra UI components to native HTML/CSS with inline styling. Modified DashboardHeader, WeatherCard, TaskList, ProgressTracker, and QuickActions components to work without ChakraProvider dependency. Removed ChakraProvider from App.tsx to eliminate the context error. Successfully tested the flow from onboarding to dashboard, confirming proper functionality of all components with mock data.
