[2025-05-08 12:49:00] - Created comprehensive plan for app restructuring using jobs-to-be-done approach. Defined new sitemap based on user goals, created detailed implementation plan with a phased approach spanning 11-17 days, documented architectural decision and rationale, and updated active context with new focus areas.

[2025-05-08 13:07:00] - Implemented Phase 1 of the jobs-to-be-done restructuring. Created MainNavigationBar component with responsive design for both desktop and mobile. Developed PageLayout component as a consistent template for all sections. Implemented skeleton container components for all new sections (FixIssuesContainer, MaintainContainer, ImproveContainer, TrackContainer, ResourcesContainer). Updated App.tsx with new routing structure. Now ready to test the navigation system.

[2025-05-08 13:19:00] - Enhanced the navigation implementation by creating an AppLayout component to wrap the MainNavigationBar around all protected routes. Fixed positioning for responsive layouts with desktop navigation at top and mobile navigation at bottom of screen. Integrated this into the routing system using React Router's nested routes. Encountered Firebase authentication errors during testing which will need to be addressed.
