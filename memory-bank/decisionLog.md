# LawnSync - Decision Log

## Architectural Decisions

### [2025-05-05 14:40:00] - Project Documentation Structure
**Decision**: Adopt Roo Code Memory Bank for project documentation and context management.

**Rationale**: The Roo Code Memory Bank provides a structured approach to maintaining project context across development sessions, ensuring consistent understanding of project requirements and progress.

**Implications**: 
- Requires initial setup of memory-bank directory and associated files
- Standardizes documentation format across the project
- Enhances collaboration through consistent project knowledge sharing

### [2025-05-05 14:42:00] - Mobile-First Design Approach
**Decision**: Implement a mobile-first design strategy for all user interfaces.

**Rationale**: Primary use case involves users interacting with the app while physically in their yard examining their lawn. Mobile-first ensures the core experience is optimized for this scenario.

**Implications**:
- UI components must be designed for touch interaction first
- Screen real estate must be used efficiently
- Desktop experience will be derived from mobile designs rather than vice versa

## Technical Decisions

### [2025-05-05 14:45:00] - Technology Stack Selection
**Decision**: Selected React with Vite for frontend, Firebase and Supabase for backend services, and Netlify for deployment.

**Rationale**: This stack provides a responsive web app solution that can be accessed from any device, serverless architecture for scalability, and integrated authentication and storage solutions.

**Implications**:
- Team needs expertise in React, Firebase, and Supabase
- State management will be handled with Zustand
- Chakra UI will provide accessible and responsive components

### [2025-05-05 14:50:00] - External API Integration
**Decision**: Integrate with OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo for advice generation, Plant.id for plant identification, and OpenWeatherMap for weather data.

**Rationale**: These APIs provide specialized capabilities essential to the core features without requiring in-house development of complex ML models.

**Implications**:
- API costs will scale with user growth
- Need to implement caching strategies to minimize API calls
- Must build fallback mechanisms for API outages

### [2025-05-05 14:55:00] - State Management Approach
**Decision**: Use Zustand for state management instead of Redux or Context API.

**Rationale**: Zustand provides a simpler API with less boilerplate than Redux while offering better performance than Context API for complex state.

**Implications**:
- More straightforward implementation of state logic
- Easier learning curve for team members
- Need to establish patterns for store organization

## Feature Decisions

### [2025-05-05 14:48:00] - Visual Timeline Implementation
**Decision**: Implement the visual timeline as a core feature from MVP stage.

**Rationale**: The ability to visualize lawn improvement over time is a key differentiator and motivation factor for users. User testing confirms this is a highly desired feature.

**Implications**:
- Need efficient image storage and processing system
- Must implement consistent photo guidance for reliable comparisons
- Will require image analysis capabilities for automated improvement detection

### [2025-05-05 23:30:00] - Multi-step Onboarding Flow Implementation
**Decision**: Implement a comprehensive, multi-step onboarding flow with location selection, lawn type selection, and goal prioritization.

**Rationale**: A detailed onboarding process allows us to collect all necessary information to provide truly personalized recommendations while also demonstrating the app's value before requesting account creation.

**Implications**:
- Need to manage state across multiple steps of the onboarding process
- Must balance comprehensive data collection with user engagement
- Requires validation to ensure quality of collected data
- Review screen provides transparency on how user data will be used

### [2025-05-05 23:30:00] - Leaflet.js Integration for Location Visualization
**Decision**: Integrate Leaflet.js for interactive map visualization in the Location screen.

**Rationale**: Visual map representation provides users with confirmation that their location is correctly understood by the system and enhances the overall user experience with interactive elements.

**Implications**:
- Additional library dependency and bundle size
- Need to handle map rendering and marker placement efficiently
- Must manage geocoding integration for address-to-coordinates conversion

### [2025-05-05 23:52:00] - Dashboard UI Component Implementation
**Decision**: Implement the dashboard with modular components for weather, tasks, progress tracking, and quick actions.

**Rationale**: A modular dashboard design provides better user experience by organizing related information in discrete sections while facilitating code maintenance and future enhancements.

**Implications**:
- Each component can be developed and tested independently
- Layout must be responsive across device sizes
- Components need consistent styling and interaction patterns
- Future data integration points must be defined for each component

### [2025-05-05 23:57:00] - Memory Bank Update Methodology
**Decision**: Use write_to_file instead of append_to_file for Memory Bank updates due to a technical limitation in the current implementation.

**Rationale**: Debugging revealed that append_to_file fails silently when attempting to update Memory Bank files, while write_to_file works as expected. This workaround ensures reliable documentation updates.

**Implications**:
- Need to always read the current file content before updating
- More complex update process requiring full file rewriting
- Must maintain careful formatting to avoid corrupting Memory Bank files
- Should document this workaround for all team members

### [2025-05-06 00:09:00] - Temporary Removal of Chakra UI Provider
**Decision**: Temporarily remove ChakraProvider wrapper from the application to resolve build errors with Chakra UI v3.17.0.

**Rationale**: The current implementation of ChakraProvider was incompatible with version 3.17.0, causing TypeScript errors due to changed prop requirements in the API. Removing it enables successful builds while a proper solution is developed.

**Implications**:
- Components will fall back to default styling without theming
- We'll need to implement a proper solution in a future task
- Documented the issue in a commented-out wrapper component for future reference
- Will need to carefully test UI components that relied on Chakra theming
