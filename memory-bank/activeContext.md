# LawnSync - Active Context

## Current Focus
- Building mobile-first UI components with the LawnSync theme
- Implementing Weather-Adaptive Task Scheduling system
- Integrating OpenWeatherMap API for real-time weather data
- Preparing codebase architecture for scaling

## Development Workflow
- GitFlow branching model with development and master branches
- Feature branches are created from development, then merged back
- Master branch contains production-ready code
- Feature branches are deleted after successful merging to keep repository clean

## Current Sprint Goals
- ✅ Implement TaskSchedulerService with mock/real toggle
- ✅ Create mobile-first calendar view for task scheduling
- ✅ Add weather-adaptive scheduling logic
- ✅ Enhance TaskList with weather indicators
- ✅ Integrate scheduled tasks with recommended tasks
- Implement AI recommendation engine
- Add photo gallery for lawn progress tracking
- Add AI-based plant identification

## Open Questions/Issues
- What mechanisms should we add to handle API key security for production use of OpenWeatherMap?
- How to optimize the loading of weather data to maximize responsiveness?
- Should we implement a more formal state management system like Redux or stick with React context?
- What approach should we take for unit and integration testing?
- How to improve the task scheduling algorithm for more accurate weather-based recommendations?

## Technical Debt
- Some components need proper TypeScript interfaces
- Refactor inline styles to Chakra theme components when compatibility issues resolved
- Add proper form validation
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add unit tests for TaskSchedulerService and TaskScheduler component

## Recent Changes
- Created full user onboarding flow with multi-step navigation
- Implemented Firebase Authentication with mock implementation for testing
- Set up protected routes for authenticated users
- Added mock implementations for Firebase Authentication and Firestore database
- Implemented in-memory storage for local testing without Firebase project
- Added network delay simulation for realistic UX testing
- Implemented OpenWeatherMap integration with mock/real toggle pattern following Firebase service pattern
- Added intelligent caching system for weather data to minimize API calls
- Enhanced WeatherCard with dynamic weather-based lawn care tips
- Completed Git branch cleanup to maintain repository organization
- Created implementation plan for Weather-Adaptive Task Scheduling system
- Implemented TaskSchedulerService with mock/real toggle and weather-adaptive logic
- Built TypeScript interfaces for the task scheduling system
- Created a mobile-first TaskScheduler component with interactive calendar view
- Enhanced TaskList with weather appropriateness indicators and detailed task view
- Implemented tab navigation between task list and calendar views in the Dashboard

## Next Steps
- Implement AI recommendation engine
- Build photo gallery and progress comparison tools
- Add AI-based plant identification
- Improve task scheduling algorithms for more precise weather-based recommendations
- Add unit tests for critical components
- Implement offline capabilities
- Prepare for beta testing
