# LawnSync - Active Context

## Current Focus
- Setting up initial project structure in the Roo Code Memory Bank
- Beginning Days 1-7 core infrastructure setup
- Implementing mobile-first UI theme with design system components
- Working on core Chakra UI theme foundations for LawnSync
- Developing onboarding flow with multiple screens and data collection
- Implementing dashboard components and user interface
- Resolving UI framework compatibility issues

## Current Session
- Establishing Memory Bank files for LawnSync project
- Integrating technical architecture documentation
- Preparing for 30-day development timeline
- Planning React component structure with Chakra UI
- Implementing onboarding screens for lawn profiles
- Creating dashboard with personalized lawn care plan display
- Debugging and resolving Chakra UI compatibility issues

## Next Steps
1. Create development environment setup and configuration
2. Define initial API specifications for weather data integration
3. Establish database schema for user profiles and lawn data
4. Begin work on AI recommendation engine logic
5. Evaluate long-term strategy for UI components (native HTML/CSS vs Chakra UI vs other frameworks)

## Open Questions
- What caching strategy should we implement for OpenWeatherMap API to balance freshness and API call limits?
- Should we implement social login options through Firebase alongside traditional email/password authentication?
- What approach should we take for offline photo storage to ensure sync when connectivity is restored?
- How should we structure Zustand stores to optimize state management across the application?
- What testing strategy should we implement for the AI recommendation components?
- How to address the Memory Bank file update issue where append_to_file doesn't work but write_to_file does?
- Should we continue using Chakra UI with workarounds, or transition completely to another UI approach?
