# LawnSync - Active Context

## Current Focus
- Building mobile-first UI components with the LawnSync theme
- Implementing Weather-Adaptive Task Scheduling system
- Integrating OpenWeatherMap API for real-time weather data
- Implementing Lawn Progress Gallery for visual timeline tracking
- Implementing Smart Watering Schedule with weather forecast integration
- Preparing codebase architecture for scaling

## Development Workflow
- GitFlow branching model with development and master branches
- Feature branches are created from development, then merged back
- Master branch contains production-ready code
- Feature branches are deleted after successful merging to keep repository clean

## Current Sprint Goals
- ✅ Implement TaskSchedulerService with mock/real toggle
- ✅ Create mobile-first calendar view for task scheduling
- ✅ Add weather-adaptive scheduling logic
- ✅ Enhance TaskList with weather indicators
- ✅ Integrate scheduled tasks with recommended tasks
- ✅ Implement AI recommendation engine
- ✅ Add photo gallery for lawn progress tracking
- ✅ Add AI-based plant identification
- ✅ Implement Smart Watering Schedule with weather integration

## Open Questions/Issues
- What mechanisms should we add to handle API key security for production use of OpenWeatherMap?
- How to optimize the loading of weather data to maximize responsiveness?
- Should we implement a more formal state management system like Redux or stick with React context?
- What approach should we take for unit and integration testing?
- How to improve the task scheduling algorithm for more accurate weather-based recommendations?
- How to further enhance the watering schedule algorithm based on soil moisture sensor data?

## Technical Debt
- Some components need proper TypeScript interfaces
- Refactor inline styles to Chakra theme components when compatibility issues resolved
- Add proper form validation
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add unit tests for TaskSchedulerService and TaskScheduler component
- Add unit tests for WateringService and related components
